The four links from https://catalog.archives.gov/id/1263923 give the four raw files.

in raw_downloads:
	- ASNEF.FIN.zip is the zipped .dat file that actually has the enlistment data.
	- 100.1ND_NC.pdf is the beginning of the technical documentation.
	- 100.1CL_SD.pdf is the code list (VERY USEFUL!).
	- ASNF_TSS.pdf is a certificate with the dates of the version download.
